Hey there!, itâ€™s me"Ahmed Samir", 26 yr, iOS Programming aficionado, and B.Sc in Computer Science from University of Mansoura.

Once upon a time, I fell in love with Apple brand, and decided to write code, and learn programming language affiliated to it. It started with a simple syntax of Objective-C in my fresh year as a computer science undergraduate, in 2016 decided to learn Swift. In 2020 I got a training at Robusta, and got a chance to improve my technical and soft skills. And for almost 3 years I've explored a lot of caves, dived the deepest oceans, and shared some projects on my Github.

Passionate about AR, Machine Learning, and have a good knowledge of different fields like IoT, AI, and Games.
